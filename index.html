    <h1>What is React? What are its features</h1>
    <p>react was created by jordane walke a software engineer in facebook in the year 2011 and it was deployed first at
        facebook news feed and later it was used in facebook and instagram</p>
    <p>react is a open source frontend javascript library.</p>
    <p>it follows the component based apporach for building reusable UI components</p>
    <p>it is specially for single page application </p>
    <p>it is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application </p>

    <h2>features</h2>
    <p>virtual dom</p>
    <p>one way data binding</p>
    <p>resuable components</p>
    <p>jsx(javascript syntax extension)</p>
    <p>performance</p>

    <h1>Explain Virtual DOM</h1>
    <p>DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets
        created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time., whenever React components
        gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button
        click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to
        Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual
        dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another virtual
        dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will
        get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing
        algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.
    </p>

    <h1>Why you have opted for React not Angular or Vue</h1>
    <h3>library is a set of resuable function used by computer programs</h3>
    <p>code calls the library </p>
    <p>in library we can control the data flow by methods </p>
   
    <h3>framwork it is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project </h3>
    <p>but in framework :-framwork call the code.</p>
    <p>in framework we dont habe any control of the data flow .framework decide how the data will flow that is nothing
        but framework calls the code.</p>
   
    <h3>in performance wise react is having higher performance over angular and veu and community support and also react
        is having the easy learning curve and react is having SPA(single page application)</h3>


    <h1>differnce between function and class component </h1>
    <p>class components uses the lifecycle methods where as in functional component have HOOKs </p>
    <p> functional components also called stateless components while class components is called statefull components
    </p>
    <p>functional component only accepts props as an argument in class componets we have both option props and state</p>
    <p>functional components are easy to read because they have less code but class components compkex code and hard to
        write</p>
    <p>in class components we used this keyword but in function components we dont used this keyword</p>

    <h1>stateful vs stateless</h1>
    <p>stateless components does not hold or manage state while stateful components holds and manage state</p>
    <p>stateless components are easy to understand while stateful components it is complex as comapred to the stateless
        components</p>
    <p>state less components does not work with react liffecycle methods but stateful components work with react
        liffecycle methods </p>
    <p>stateless components can not be reused while we can used in case of stateful components</p>
    <p>stateless components also known as functional components and stateful is a class components</p>

    <h1>what is different phase of react components lifecycle </h1>
    <p>In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are
        termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points
        during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:</p>
    <p>four phases</p>
    <p>1.initial phase</p>
    <p>2.mounting phase</p>
    <p>updating</p>
    <p>unmounting</p>
